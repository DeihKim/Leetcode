# 📚 My LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my **LeetCode Submissions** repositoryâa space where I challenge myself daily to grow as a problem solver and future data scientist.

## 💡 Why This Repository?

This repo is my commitment to:

* **Consistency** â Solving LeetCode problems daily to build strong habits
* **Learning** â Deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms
* **Interview Prep** â Getting ready for coding interviews, one question at a time
* **Inspiration** â Encouraging others like me to start their own journey

## 🌐 Languages Used

All problems are currently solved in **Python**.  
I may start incorporating **Java** and **C** in the future for practice and versatility.

## 🎯 The Goal

Solve a little every day. Learn a little every day. Improve a little every day.  
Thatâs the mission.
