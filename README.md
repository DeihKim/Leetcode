# ð My LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my **LeetCode Submissions** repository â a space where I challenge myself daily to grow as a problem solver and future data scientist.

## ð± Why This Repository?

This repo is my commitment to:

* ð **Consistency** â Solving LeetCode problems daily to build strong habits
* ð§  **Learning** â Deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms
* ð¼ **Interview Prep** â Getting ready for coding interviews, one question at a time
* â¨ **Inspiration** â Encouraging others like me to start their own journey

## ð§° Languages Used

All problems are currently solved in **Python** ð.
I may start incorporating **Java** â and **C** ð§ in the future for practice and versatility.

## ð¯ The Goal

Solve a little every day. Learn a little every day. Improve a little every day.
Thatâs the mission.
