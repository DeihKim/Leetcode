# 🚀 My LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my **LeetCode Submissions** repository — a space where I challenge myself daily to grow as a problem solver and future data scientist.

## 🌱 Why This Repository?

This repo is my commitment to:

* 🌟 **Consistency** — Solving LeetCode problems daily to build strong habits
* 🧠 **Learning** — Deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms
* 💼 **Interview Prep** — Getting ready for coding interviews, one question at a time
* ✨ **Inspiration** — Encouraging others like me to start their own journey

## 🧰 Languages Used

All problems are currently solved in **Python** 🐍.
I may start incorporating **Java** ☕ and **C** 🔧 in the future for practice and versatility.

## 🎯 The Goal

Solve a little every day. Learn a little every day. Improve a little every day.
That’s the mission.
