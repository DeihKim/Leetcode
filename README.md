# Ã°ÂÂÂ My LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my **LeetCode Submissions** repository Ã¢ÂÂ a space where I challenge myself daily to grow as a problem solver and future data scientist.

## Ã°ÂÂÂ± Why This Repository?

This repo is my commitment to:

* Ã°ÂÂÂ **Consistency** Ã¢ÂÂ Solving LeetCode problems daily to build strong habits
* Ã°ÂÂ§Â  **Learning** Ã¢ÂÂ Deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms
* Ã°ÂÂÂ¼ **Interview Prep** Ã¢ÂÂ Getting ready for coding interviews, one question at a time
* Ã¢ÂÂ¨ **Inspiration** Ã¢ÂÂ Encouraging others like me to start their own journey

## Ã°ÂÂ§Â° Languages Used

All problems are currently solved in **Python** Ã°ÂÂÂ.
I may start incorporating **Java** Ã¢ÂÂ and **C** Ã°ÂÂÂ§ in the future for practice and versatility.

## Ã°ÂÂÂ¯ The Goal

Solve a little every day. Learn a little every day. Improve a little every day.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the mission.
